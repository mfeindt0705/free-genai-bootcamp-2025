# GenAI Architecting Project 

This README outlines the concepts behind the GenAI Bootcamp Architecting Project.


## Business Requirements

The business requirements for the GenAI Architecting Project are as follows:
create an online app that facilitates the learning of the german language for an english native speaker.
the app will be a hub for a variety of online study activites concentrating on german language skills.
the app will enable the student to interact with a teacher.

## Functional Requirements

There is a need to keep the implementation platform independent. Primary goal is to use private infrastructure. If the requirements change and are not met by local infrastructure, the implementation should be able to be moved to a public cloud provider.

## Assumptions

we are starting the project with the assumption that the app will be used by multiple users at a time. the goal is to use an open-source LLM. If this approach is not successful we will have to switch to a proprietary LLM.


## Constraints

the portal will respect copyright laws and adhere to privacy standards. 


## Data Strategy

The goal is to use freely available input material. The data should be stored in a way that it can be easily accessed and processed by the AI models.
